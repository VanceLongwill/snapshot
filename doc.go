// Package snapshot provides basic methods for snapshot testing
// Snapshot tests may be useful for regression testing or unit testing (with proper review)
// This package doesn't aim to be anything more than a simple utility to be used in conjunction with
// golang's own testing package, or any other testing framework which is also compatible with `go test`
// Snapshots are auto-generated and managed by this package:
package snapshot
